"""Shared storage-credential provisioning.

Used by every call site that needs a project's storage ready before use: project creation,
manual re-setup (`POST /project/{id}/setup-storage`), and job launch (`ProcessVersion.run_task`).
`ensure_ready()` is protocol-agnostic — it resolves the project's `StorageBackend`, picks a
`CredentialStrategy` from `backend.credential_strategy`, and the strategy delegates to whichever
`StorageProtocolHandler` `backend.protocol` resolves to (`backend/services/storage_protocols/`).
Neither `ensure_ready()` nor the strategies branch on protocol themselves — that dispatch lives
entirely in the protocol-handler registry, once, so it is never duplicated at a call site.
